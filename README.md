WT32-SC01 openHasp device to control Baby Buddy

Using this project to create a touchscreen device able to control [BabyBuddy](https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy) . At the moment just using basic controls to add feeds and diaper changes. I am using openHASP to run the plate and Home Assistant to interface with Baby Buddy.
